Suspicious links: Hover over links to check if they lead to an unexpected address. Look-a-like domain: Fake email domain might be used. Grammatical errors: Poor spelling and grammar can be a red flag. Technical red flags:\r#\rDo not share sensitive information to the public tools.\nSpoofed Sender Address: The \u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address may look legitimate, but the email header reveals a different origin. Tool: Use Email Header Analyzers (e.g., from Google Admin Toolbox or MXToolbox) to parse the full header and verify the true source. Mismatching \u0026ldquo;Reply-To\u0026rdquo; Address: The \u0026ldquo;Reply-To\u0026rdquo; address is different from the \u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address, a common tactic to bypass filters. Tool: Email Header Analyzers can highlight this mismatch and show the true reply-to address. Suspicious File Types: The email contains attachments with unusual or executable file extensions like .exe, .zip, .js, or .scr. Tool: Calculate the MD5 hash of the suspicious attachment and check it on VirusTotal before opening it. This helps detemine if the file is known malware without uploading potentially legitimatem, but sensitive, content. Embedded Macros: Attachments (e.g., Office files) prompt you to \u0026ldquo;Enable Content.\u0026rdquo; Tool: Upload the file to VirusTotal. It can often detect malicious macros within documents. URL Mismatches: The displayed link text is legitimate, but the actual URL points to a different, malicious site. Tool: Use VirusTotal or PhishTank to check the actual URL. You can also use browser extensions that provide link previews. Typosquatting/Homoglyph Attacks: The domain name has a subtle variation of a legitimate one. Tool: URL scanners like VirusTotal can identify if the domain is known to be malicious. Additionally, browser extensions can help by highlighting suspicious characters. Redirects: The link uses a shortened URL or multiple redirects to hide its true destination. Tool: URL expander services (e.g., checkshorturl.com) can reveal the final destination of a shortened link without you having to click on it. Use of IP Addresses: The link points directly to an IP address instead of a domain name. Tool: Use VirusTotal to check the reputation of the IP address and see if it\u0026rsquo;s associated with known malicious activity "},{"id":1,"href":"/cyberstudy-journal/en/glossary/","title":"Glossary","section":"Cyberstudy Journal","content":"\rcontent/en/glossary/_index.md\r#\rtitle: \u0026ldquo;Glossary\u0026rdquo; bookCollapseSection: true\r#\r"}]

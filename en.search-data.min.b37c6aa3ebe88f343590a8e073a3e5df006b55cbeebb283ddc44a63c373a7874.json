The map below provides an example of such a stack, detailing common tools and how their capabilities are mapped directly to defensive measures MITRE D3FEND tactics to counter known adversary behaviors MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK.\nSecurity Stack Layer Priority Popular Tools D3FEND Tactic D3FEND Technique Attack Phase Description / Core Function Vulnerability Management High Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, Tenable, Qualys, Rapid7, Nessus Model / Harden Network Vulnerability Assessment, Software Update Reconnaissance \u0026amp; Weaponization Continuous process of identifying, prioritizing, and remediating weaknesses (missing patches, misconfigurations) in software and hardware to reduce the attack surface. Security Awareness Training High Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Attack Simulation, KnowBe4, PhishMe, Cofense, Proofpoint Harden User Behavior Baseline Targeting Addresses the human factor by educating employees on social engineering, phishing, and proper handling of sensitive data. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Wiz, Orca Security, Cloud Security Hubs (AWS/Azure/GCP) Harden / Model Platform Hardening, Access Modeling Configuration Monitors and enforces security policies across cloud environments (IaaS/PaaS) to prevent critical misconfigurations (e.g., open storage buckets, overly permissive IAM roles). Application Security (AppSec) Microsoft Defender for DevOps,Azure DevOps/GitHub Security, Checkmarx, SonarQube (SAST/DAST), Snyk (SBOM) Harden Input Validation Design Embeds security into the development lifecycle (DevSecOps) to find and fix vulnerabilities in custom application code before deployment. Network Security (Firewall/IDS/IPS) Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper Harden / Detect Network Traffic Filtering, Network Protocol Analysis Initial Access Controls and monitors traffic at network boundaries and internal segments, blocking known threats and analyzing protocol behavior for anomalies. Identity \u0026amp; Access Management (IAM) Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Ping Identity, ForgeRock Harden Account Disabling, Role-Based Access Control Initial Access Manages and secures user identities, governing who can access which resources, managing entitlements, and enforcing provisioning/de-provisioning processes. IAM - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) High Microsoft Authenticator, Duo, YubiKey Harden Multi-Factor Authentication Initial Access Adds a required second layer of verification beyond the password, drastically reducing the risk of unauthorized access from stolen or brute-forced credentials. End-User Protection (EDR/Antivirus) High CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender, Trellix Detect / Isolate Malware Analysis, Process Monitoring, Host Isolation Execution, Lateral Movement Secures endpoints (laptops, servers) by continuously monitoring activity, detecting malicious behavior (not just signatures), and isolating compromised hosts. Privileged Access Management (PAM) Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management (PIM), CyberArk, Delinea, HashiCorp Vault, BeyondTrust Harden / Evict Credential Hardening, Credential Revoking Privilege Escalation Secures, manages, and monitors accounts with elevated permissions (admin, root), enforcing least privilege and isolating privileged sessions to prevent credential theft. Network Segmentation (NAC) Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass, Illumio Isolate Network Segmentation Lateral Movement Divides the network into isolated zones to restrict the blast radius of an attack, ensuring an intruder on one segment cannot freely move to others. Security Information \u0026amp; Event Management (SIEM) Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, IBM QRadar, Elastic Security Detect Log Analysis, Identifier Activity Analysis C2 \u0026amp; Detection The central security brain. Aggregates, normalizes, and correlates security logs from every tool and system to detect complex, multi-stage attacks in real-time. Threat Intelligence (TI) Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, Recorded Future, Mandiant, Commercial TI Feeds Detect Indicator Analysis C2 \u0026amp; Detection Provides external context on current and emerging threats, IoCs (IPs, hashes), and adversary TTPs, enriching SIEM alerts and improving detection rules. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Microsoft Purview, Symantec, Forcepoint Isolate Data Loss Restriction Exfiltration Identifies, monitors, and protects sensitive data (PII, IP, financial data) in motion, at rest, or in use, blocking unauthorized data from leaving the organization. SOAR Microsoft Sentinel Automation \u0026amp; Orchestration. Splunk Phantom, Cortex XSOAR, Swimlane, Torq Evict / Restore Automated Response Containment \u0026amp; Response Automates and orchestrates security workflows (playbooks), connecting and instructing tools across the stack (e.g., taking an SIEM alert and automatically blocking an IP on the firewall). Incident Response (IR) / DR Rubrik, Veeam (Backup), Cohesity Restore File Restoration Impact \u0026amp; Recovery Defines the plans and uses the tools for containing, eradicating, and recovering from a major security breach or disaster (e.g., restoring clean data from backups).

The incident was discovered after a business partner reported receiving a suspicious message.\n1. Immediate User Actions (CSIRT Instructions) # Reset the compromised account password immediately. Ensure it is strong and unique. Review mailbox rules and forwarding: remove any unauthorized rules or auto-forwarding. 2. Technical Containment # Technical Team:\nInvalidate all active sessions (cloud, email, VPN). Revoke VPN sessions and block suspicious IPs. Preserve logs (email, VPN, endpoint, proxy). 3. Forensic Investigation # Forensic Team:\nAnalyze suspicious logins (IP, device, region, timing). Examine endpoint(s) for malware, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement. Review mailbox and file access logs. Check email forwarding rules, OAuth app authorizations, and any suspicious scripts. Preserve chain of evidence for potential legal or regulatory proceedings. Coordinate with Legal/Compliance if sensitive data exposure is suspected. 4. Legal \u0026amp; Compliance # Legal/Compliance Team:\nDetermine if sensitive or regulated data was exposed. Check contractual obligations and reporting requirements. Advise CSIRT on regulatory notifications and escalation procedures. 5. Communications \u0026amp; External Coordination # PR/Communications Team:\nPrepare notifications to affected recipients (warning not to open/click suspicious emails). Coordinate messages with Legal and Management. Prepare potential media statements if incident escalates. Management Liaison:\nBrief executives on business impact and reputational risk. 6. Recovery \u0026amp; Remediation # Technical Team:\nClean or reimage compromised endpoints. Restore secure account access (MFA enforced). Update monitoring rules and tighten email security policies. 7. Lessons Learned \u0026amp; Governance # CSIRT \u0026amp; All Teams:\nConduct post-incident review: document root cause, actions, and lessons learned. Strengthen policies: mandatory MFA, password policies, log retention. Educate users on phishing, reporting suspicious activity, and safe email practices.

Suspicious links: Hover over links to check if they lead to an unexpected address. Look-a-like domain: Fake email domain might be used. Grammatical errors: Poor spelling and grammar can be a red flag. Technical red flags: # Do not share sensitive information to the public tools.\nSpoofed Sender Address: The \u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address may look legitimate, but the email header reveals a different origin. Tool: Use Email Header Analyzers (e.g., from Google Admin Toolbox or MXToolbox) to parse the full header and verify the true source. Mismatching \u0026ldquo;Reply-To\u0026rdquo; Address: The \u0026ldquo;Reply-To\u0026rdquo; address is different from the \u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address, a common tactic to bypass filters. Tool: Email Header Analyzers can highlight this mismatch and show the true reply-to address. Suspicious File Types: The email contains attachments with unusual or executable file extensions like .exe, .zip, .js, or .scr. Tool: Calculate the MD5 hash of the suspicious attachment and check it on VirusTotal before opening it. This helps detemine if the file is known malware without uploading potentially legitimatem, but sensitive, content. Embedded Macros: Attachments (e.g., Office files) prompt you to \u0026ldquo;Enable Content.\u0026rdquo; Tool: Upload the file to VirusTotal. It can often detect malicious macros within documents. URL Mismatches: The displayed link text is legitimate, but the actual URL points to a different, malicious site. Tool: Use VirusTotal or PhishTank to check the actual URL. You can also use browser extensions that provide link previews. Typosquatting/Homoglyph Attacks: The domain name has a subtle variation of a legitimate one. Tool: URL scanners like VirusTotal can identify if the domain is known to be malicious. Additionally, browser extensions can help by highlighting suspicious characters. Redirects: The link uses a shortened URL or multiple redirects to hide its true destination. Tool: URL expander services (e.g., checkshorturl.com) can reveal the final destination of a shortened link without you having to click on it. Use of IP Addresses: The link points directly to an IP address instead of a domain name. Tool: Use VirusTotal to check the reputation of the IP address and see if it\u0026rsquo;s associated with known malicious activity "},{"id":4,"href":"/cyberstudy-journal/en/glossary/","title":"Glossary","section":"Welcome to Cyberstudy Journal","content":" Glossary # Cybersecurity related Glossaries.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/cyberstudy-journal/en/incident-response/","title":"Incident Response","section":"Welcome to Cyberstudy Journal","content":" Inident Response # Incident response table-top simulation.\n"}]

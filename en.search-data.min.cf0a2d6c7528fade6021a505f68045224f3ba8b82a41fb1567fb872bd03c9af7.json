The incident was discovered after a business partner reported receiving a suspicious message.\n1. Immediate User Actions (CSIRT Instructions) # Reset the compromised account password immediately. Ensure it is strong and unique. Review mailbox rules and forwarding: remove any unauthorized rules or auto-forwarding. 2. Technical Containment # Technical Team:\nInvalidate all active sessions (cloud, email, VPN). Revoke VPN sessions and block suspicious IPs. Preserve logs (email, VPN, endpoint, proxy). 3. Forensic Investigation # Forensic Team:\nAnalyze suspicious logins (IP, device, region, timing). Examine endpoint(s) for malware, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement. Review mailbox and file access logs. Check email forwarding rules, OAuth app authorizations, and any suspicious scripts. Preserve chain of evidence for potential legal or regulatory proceedings. Coordinate with Legal/Compliance if sensitive data exposure is suspected. 4. Legal \u0026amp; Compliance # Legal/Compliance Team:\nDetermine if sensitive or regulated data was exposed. Check contractual obligations and reporting requirements. Advise CSIRT on regulatory notifications and escalation procedures. 5. Communications \u0026amp; External Coordination # PR/Communications Team:\nPrepare notifications to affected recipients (warning not to open/click suspicious emails). Coordinate messages with Legal and Management. Prepare potential media statements if incident escalates. Management Liaison:\nBrief executives on business impact and reputational risk. 6. Recovery \u0026amp; Remediation # Technical Team:\nClean or reimage compromised endpoints. Restore secure account access (MFA enforced). Update monitoring rules and tighten email security policies. 7. Lessons Learned \u0026amp; Governance # CSIRT \u0026amp; All Teams:\nConduct post-incident review: document root cause, actions, and lessons learned. Strengthen policies: mandatory MFA, password policies, log retention. Educate users on phishing, reporting suspicious activity, and safe email practices.

Suspicious links: Hover over links to check if they lead to an unexpected address. Look-a-like domain: Fake email domain might be used. Grammatical errors: Poor spelling and grammar can be a red flag. Technical red flags: # Do not share sensitive information to the public tools.\nSpoofed Sender Address: The \u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address may look legitimate, but the email header reveals a different origin. Tool: Use Email Header Analyzers (e.g., from Google Admin Toolbox or MXToolbox) to parse the full header and verify the true source. Mismatching \u0026ldquo;Reply-To\u0026rdquo; Address: The \u0026ldquo;Reply-To\u0026rdquo; address is different from the \u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; address, a common tactic to bypass filters. Tool: Email Header Analyzers can highlight this mismatch and show the true reply-to address. Suspicious File Types: The email contains attachments with unusual or executable file extensions like .exe, .zip, .js, or .scr. Tool: Calculate the MD5 hash of the suspicious attachment and check it on VirusTotal before opening it. This helps detemine if the file is known malware without uploading potentially legitimatem, but sensitive, content. Embedded Macros: Attachments (e.g., Office files) prompt you to \u0026ldquo;Enable Content.\u0026rdquo; Tool: Upload the file to VirusTotal. It can often detect malicious macros within documents. URL Mismatches: The displayed link text is legitimate, but the actual URL points to a different, malicious site. Tool: Use VirusTotal or PhishTank to check the actual URL. You can also use browser extensions that provide link previews. Typosquatting/Homoglyph Attacks: The domain name has a subtle variation of a legitimate one. Tool: URL scanners like VirusTotal can identify if the domain is known to be malicious. Additionally, browser extensions can help by highlighting suspicious characters. Redirects: The link uses a shortened URL or multiple redirects to hide its true destination. Tool: URL expander services (e.g., checkshorturl.com) can reveal the final destination of a shortened link without you having to click on it. Use of IP Addresses: The link points directly to an IP address instead of a domain name. Tool: Use VirusTotal to check the reputation of the IP address and see if it\u0026rsquo;s associated with known malicious activity "},{"id":3,"href":"/cyberstudy-journal/en/glossary/","title":"Glossary","section":"Welcome to Cyberstudy Journal","content":"Cybersecurity related Glossaries.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/cyberstudy-journal/en/incident-response/","title":"Incident Response","section":"Welcome to Cyberstudy Journal","content":"Incident response table-top simulation.\n"}]
